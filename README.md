# Am2900ME
Fully functional emulator for basic Am2900 Family Microprogramming

## [Get it here](../../releases)
Based on [The Am2900 Family Data Book](../../blob/master/additional_material/1979_AMD_2900family_large.pdf "PDF scan; © Advanced Micro Devices Inc., 1979") (*[recommended excerpt](../../blob/master/additional_material/1979_AMD_2900family_excerpt.pdf "PDF scan; © Advanced Micro Devices Inc., 1979 - Excerpt")*)
and the specific 16 bit configuration used by the Technical University of Munich to teach microprogramming. 
The most important circuits like e.g. the Am2901, Am2904 and Am2910 are separate, independent classes and could therefore be used to realize completely different machine configurations.

See the [Wiki](../../wiki/A-short-introduction-to-the-Am2900ME) for more detailed information.

#### [SWT-Version of the Am2900ME (smaller, works with Java 1.8+)](https://github.com/Haspamelodica/Am2900ME_swt)
*Note that there might be small differences, but both should be compatible now.*
